# ckeditor5-build-full

## 25.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`74a0e92`](https://github.com/hieutranse111/ckeditor5-build-full/commit/74a0e92a9546811ef0da45164dbd943b7aa3258c) Thanks [@hieutranse111](https://github.com/hieutranse111)! - Add ESM and CJS builds alongside UMD, bundle TypeScript declarations, and correct the
  license to GPL-2.0-or-later to match upstream CKEditor 5.

  `main` now points at `./dist/index.cjs`. Importing the package by name is unchanged;
  deep imports of `lib/ckeditor.js` still resolve through the exports map.
